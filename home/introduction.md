# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This is `R-ESP` (Roblox-ESP). A project that is heavily inspired by a pre-existing ESP library called [sense](https://github.com/shlexware/Sirius/tree/request/library/sense). It aims to provide an intuitive, efficient, object-orientated experience.

This only support Synapse V3 due to it using the new Drawing API and some functions like `getboundingbox` and `worldtoscreen`.
